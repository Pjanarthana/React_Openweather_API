Getting Started:
Prerequisites:
    .Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.js
    .Node.js and npm installed on your machine
    .An OpenWeather API key. Sign up at OpenWeather.


Setting Up React:
  1. Create a New React App
  2. Install Axios for API Requests

 Authentication:
        Every API call requires an API key. You must include this key as a parameter in your API requests.


API Endpoints:
    Current Weather Data
    Retrieve current weather data for a specific location by city name, city ID, geographic coordinates, or ZIP code. 


7-Week Forecast:
     Retrieve a weather forecast for the upcoming 7 weeks.


City Search:
    Search for weather data by city name.


Fetching Weather Data:
    Create an API Service
    Create a file named api.js in the src directory to handle API requests

Displaying Weather Data:
    Create a file name current-Weather 
    Create a file named current-Weather.js in the src directory to display the weather data


Integrate Weather Component into App:
    Modify the App.js file to include the Weather component.


Error Handling:
Handle errors gracefully by displaying error messages to users. This is done in the current-Weather.js component where an error state is set if an API request fails.

Rate Limits:
OpenWeather API has different rate limits based on your subscription plan. Free tier typically allows up to 60 requests per minute. Refer to the pricing page for more details.

FAQ:
How do I sign up for an API key?
